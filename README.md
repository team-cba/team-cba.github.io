# **HEY ESTÃšPIDO!**  
*This is the CBA Project!*  

Welcome to the **CBA Project**, where we create websites for anyone and everyone (well, mostly students at my school). Here's how it works:  

### **Options:**  
1. **Bad:**  
   - Only HTML.  
   - No CSS, no JavaScript.  
   - Just... there.  

2. **Meh:**  
   - HTML with some CSS.  
   - Looks okay, but nothing fancy.  

3. **Yes:**  
   - Full HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
   - Feedback feature included!

### **Pricing:**  
- **Bad:** $5  
- **Meh:** $10  
- **Yes:** $25
